AKU: Long ago, in a distant land, I, Aku, the shape-shifting master of darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil.

But, a foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword, stepped forth to oppose me.

(SWORD CLANGING)

Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time and flung him into the future, where my evil is law.

Now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is Aku.

I wish to lodge here.

Okay.

Oh! This is the bed.

And this is the bathroom.

And... And this, is the window! (SOBBING)

Is there something wrong?

The music.

Olivia!

No, Olivia! Please!

Honey, don't you recognize me?

Olivia!

It's me, your father.

Please snap out of it, dear.

No, honey! No!

This isn't who you are!

(MUSIC CONTINUES)

No, wait!

They're children!

(WHISTLE BLOWS)

(MUSIC FADES)

No, Olivia! Don't go!

Come back!

(SOBBING)

Who were they?

The children of Aku.

Aku!

Truly his evil has spread through even the youngest of souls.

Yes.

My daughter was innocent once.

But she came home with this.

My little girl was never the same since that night.

She became one of them.

(SOBBING)

Wait!

Where are you going?

To free your daughter and the rest of the children from Aku's evil grasp.

Welcome.

Brothers and sisters!

Can I get a "Kazaam"?

ALL: Kazaam!

I, DJ Stylbator, am once again here to drop upon you all the majestical, sounderific beats of the master...

ALL: Aku.

Skizz, yeah!

Let your ears feast to the flavor of the Aku-stic sound!

And for public enemy number one, the scratch in Aku's groove, Samurai Wack.

Let's mix it up with a taste of the bass, beats in his face, the brand-new hard-core track...

Jack Attack!

(ALL GROWLING)

(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYING)

There are too many! I must stop the music.

Oh, no! It won't be that easy.

Music-maker man, your beats are bad.

That's right. They're bad!

Not bad good, bad bad!

Whatever!

Aku's control on these innocents will stop.

Aku will never be silenced!

(TECHNO MUSIC CONTINUES)

Let the sounds form your ultimate destruction.

(GASPS)

(GUN FIRING)

ALL: Ooh!

No!

Aku's-evil-music will-be-no-more!

(SPEAKERS BUZZING)

Oh. Uh...

You have been pawns of Aku's evil.

But now you are free.

Return to your homes and never dance to this evil beat again.

(DOOR OPENING)

Father?

Olivia? Father!

Olivia! Father!

Olivia!

(BOTH SOBBING)

BOTH: I'm so happy!

Thank you, stranger.
